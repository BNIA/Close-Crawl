# Usage

Two versions of command line interfaces are also included for their stability. A version with command line arguments allows users to pipe their arguments via the command line. The other version involves more user interface and is therefore ideal to be converted into an executable.

<sup>Example usage in v0.9.6</sup>

## Executable

For the production version, only the contents in the `dist` folder are required. The rest of the repository can be safely removed if they are not being used for development.
